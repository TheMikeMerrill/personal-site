abstract: Data-driven scientific discovery requires the iterative integration of scientific
  domain knowledge, statistical expertise, and an understanding of data semantics
  to make nuanced analytical decisions, e.g., about which variables, transformations,
  and statistical models to consider. LM-based agents equipped with planning, memory,
  and code execution capabilities have the potential to support data-driven science.
  However, evaluating agents on such open-ended tasks is challenging due to multiple
  valid approaches, partially correct steps, and different ways to express the same
  decisions. To address these challenges, we present BLADE, a benchmark to automatically
  evaluate agents’ multifaceted approaches to openended research questions. BLADE
  consists of 12 datasets and research questions drawn from existing scientific literature,
  with ground truth collected from independent analyses by expert data scientists
  and researchers. To automatically evaluate agent responses, we developed corresponding
  computational methods to match different representations of analyses to this ground
  truth. Though language models possess considerable world knowledge, our evaluation
  shows that they are often limited to basic analyses. However, agents capable of
  interacting with the underlying data demonstrate improved, but still non-optimal,
  diversity in their analytical decision making. Our work enables the evaluation of
  agents for data-driven science and provides researchers deeper insights into agents’
  analysis approaches.
