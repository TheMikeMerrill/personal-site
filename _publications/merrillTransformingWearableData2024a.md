abstract: Despite the proliferation of wearable health trackers and the importance
  of sleep and exercise to health, deriving actionable personalized insights from
  wearable data remains a challenge because doing so requires non-trivial open-ended
  analysis of these data. The recent rise of large language model (LLM) agents, which
  can use tools to reason about and interact with the world, presents a promising
  opportunity to enable such personalized analysis at scale. Yet, the application
  of LLM agents in analyzing personal health is still largely untapped. In this paper,
  we introduce the Personal Health Insights Agent (PHIA), an agent system that leverages
  state-of-the-art code generation and information retrieval tools to analyze and
  interpret behavioral health data from wearables. We curate two benchmark question
  answering datasets of over 4000 health insights questions. Based on 650 hours of
  human and expert evaluation we find that PHIA can accurately address over 84\% of
  factual numerical questions and more than 83\% of crowd-sourced open-ended questions.
  This work has implications for advancing behavioral health across the population,
  potentially enabling individuals to interpret their own wearable data, and paving
  the way for a new era of accessible, personalized wellness regimens that are informed
  by data-driven insights.
