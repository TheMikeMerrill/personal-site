abstract: Objective This purpose of this study was to describe and demonstrate CrossCheck,
  a multimodal data collection system designed to aid in continuous remote monitoring
  and identification of subjective and objective indicators of psychotic relapse Methods
  Individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders received a smartphone with the
  monitoring system installed along with unlimited data plan for 12 months. Participants
  were instructed to carry the device with them and to complete brief self-reports
  multiple times a week. Multi-modal behavioral sensing (i.e., physical activity,
  geospatial activity, speech frequency and duration) and device use data (i.e., call
  and text activity, app use) were captured automatically. Five individuals who experienced
  psychiatric hospitalization were selected and described for instructive purposes.
  Results Participants had unique digital indicators of their psychotic relapse. For
  some, self-reports provided clear and potentially actionable description of symptom
  exacerbation prior to hospitalization. Others had behavioral sensing data trends
  (e.g., shifts in geolocation patterns, declines in physical activity) or device
  use patterns (e.g., increased nighttime app use, discontinuation of all smartphone
  use) that reflected the changes they experienced more effectively. Conclusion Advancements
  in mobile technology are enabling collection of an abundance of information that
  until recently was largely inaccessible to clinical research and practice. However,
  remote monitoring and relapse detection is in its nascency. Development and evaluation
  of innovative data management, modeling, and signal-detection techniques that can
  identify changes within an individual over time (i.e. unique relapse signatures)
  will be essential if we are to capitalize on these data to improve treatment and
  prevention.
