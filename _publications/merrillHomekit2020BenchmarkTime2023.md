abstract: 'Despite increased interest in wearables as tools for detecting various
  health conditions, there are not as of yet any large public benchmarks for such
  mobile sensing data. The few datasets that are available do not contain data from
  more than dozens of individuals, do not contain high-resolution raw data or do not
  include dataloaders for easy integration into machine learning pipelines. Here,
  we present Homekit2020: the first large-scale public benchmark for time series classification
  of wearable sensor data. Our dataset contains over 14 million hours of minute-level
  multimodal FitBit data, symptom reports, and ground-truth laboratory PCR influenza
  test results, along with an evaluation framework that mimics realistic model deployments
  and efficiently characterizes statistical uncertainty in model selection in the
  presence of extreme class imbalance. Furthermore, we implement and evaluate nine
  neural and non-neural time series classification models on our benchmark across
  450 total training runs in order to establish state of the art performance.'
