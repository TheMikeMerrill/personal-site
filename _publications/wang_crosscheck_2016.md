abstract: Early detection of mental health changes in individuals with serious mental
  illness is critical for effective intervention. CrossCheck is the ﬁrst step towards
  the passive monitoring of mental health indicators in patients with schizophrenia
  and paves the way towards relapse prediction and early intervention. In this paper,
  we present initial results from an ongoing randomized control trial, where passive
  smartphone sensor data is collected from 21 outpatients with schizophrenia recently
  discharged from hospital over a period ranging from 2-8.5 months. Our results indicate
  that there are statistically signiﬁcant associations between automatically tracked
  behavioral features related to sleep, mobility, conversations, smartphone usage
  and self-reported indicators of mental health in schizophrenia. Using these features
  we build inference models capable of accurately predicting aggregated scores of
  mental health indicators in schizophrenia with a mean error of 7.6\% of the score
  range. Finally, we discuss results on the level of personalization that is needed
  to account for the known variations within people. We show that by leveraging knowledge
  from a population with schizophrenia, it is possible to train accurate personalized
  models that require fewer individual-speciﬁc data to quickly adapt to new users.
