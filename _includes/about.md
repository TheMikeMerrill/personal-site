I am a fifth (and final?) year PhD student at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at The University of Washington, where I am advised by [Tim Althoff](http://www.timalthoff.com/). I am also a Student Researcher at Google. **I'm looking for a job!** If you think we'd be a good match, please reach out. Previously, I was an ML Research Intern at [Apple Health AI](https://machinelearning.apple.com/work-with-us) and a data scientist and the second full-time employee at [HealthRhythms](https://www.healthrhythms.com).
