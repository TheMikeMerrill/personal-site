My work focuses on methods, datasets, and benchmarks for training and evaluating language models on __time series data__ [[1]](https://mikemerrill.io/resources/pubpdfs/merrillLanguageModelsStill2024.pdf)[[2]](https://mikemerrill.io/resources/pubpdfs/tanAreLanguageModels2024.pdf) and __code generation__ [[3]](https://mikemerrill.io/resources/pubpdfs/guBLADEBenchmarkingLanguage2024a.pdf)[[4]](https://mikemerrill.io/resources/pubpdfs/merrillTransformingWearableData2024a.pdf)[[5]](https://mikemerrill.io/resources/pubpdfs/merrill2021multiverse.pdf). 
Recently I have been working on building better datasets for training reasoning LLMs.
